# First Podium of the Season!

What an incredible race at Road America! After months of preparation and countless hours of practice, we finally achieved our first podium finish of the season.

## The Race

Starting from P8, we had our work cut out for us. The key was maintaining consistency and staying out of trouble while faster drivers battled ahead. By lap 20, we had moved up to P5, and with some smart pit strategy, we found ourselves in P3 with just 10 minutes to go.

## What We Learned

- Patience pays off in endurance racing
- Clean air makes all the difference
- Setup tweaks from practice sessions really helped with tire degradation

Looking forward to building on this momentum for the next race at Spa-Francorchamps!
